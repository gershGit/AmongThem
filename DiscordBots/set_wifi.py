#TODO log IP address and WiFi SSID
#Notify the user to connect to arduino
#Once connected the arduino should send a request for Wifi SSID and password
#Input this info and send it over to the arduino, immediately begin the server

#TODO arduino side
#Create a WiFi hotspot and server
#On connection, send request for SSID and password
#On receive, wait 10 seconds and then attempt to connect (this gives the server time to start up)
